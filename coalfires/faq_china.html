    <!-- Single questions -->
    <a href="#TOP"><img src="images/arrow_orange_top.gif" alt="Back to the top" border="0" hspace="3" /></a> <a name="Q1" id="Q1"><strong>Where in China do coal fires occur?</strong></a><br />
    <p align="justify">Coal reserves of China are concentrated in the northern part of the country.  The coal mining belt stretches 5000 km in China, from east to west, with a  width of 750 km in the north-south direction. Coal fires are spread in this  entire belt.<br />
    </p>
    <p align="justify">International Institute for Aerospace Survey and Earth Sciences (ITC) has  worked for nearly a decade to study these coal fires in two test areas - one  in Xinjiang and the other in the Ningxia Hui autonomous region. For more  information on these studies and projects visit the <a href="http://www.itc.nl/%7Ecoalfire/">ITC's&nbsp;Coalfire&nbsp;Homepage.</a></p>
    <p> <a href="#TOP"><img src="images/arrow_orange_top.gif" alt="Back to the top" border="0" hspace="3" /></a> <a name="Q2" id="Q2"><strong>What is the magnitude of damage caused by these coal fires in terms of the amount of coal burnt and amount of CO2 released?</strong></a><br />
    </p>
    <p align="justify">The figures given by various scientistific groups vary in this regard.  According to reports of the Beijing Remote Sensing Corporation (BRSC),  Aerophotogrammetry and Remote Sensing Bureau of China Coal (ARSC) and works  of Professor Guan Haiyan from China, the annual loss of coal due to coal  fires in China is between 10 to 20 million tons. However, figures given by  Rozema <em>et al.</em> in 1993 are 10 times higher which means that 100 to 200  million tons of coal are lost due to coal fires in China. This is 5 to 10  times the amount of coal exported by China annually. In 1992, the carbon  dioxide released from burning of such large amounts of coal in China itself  was projected to be 2 to 3 % of the world's total carbon dioxide emission  from fossil fuels (source: Cassells and van Genderen, 1995).</p>
    <p> <a href="#TOP"><img src="images/arrow_orange_top.gif" alt="Back to the top" border="0" hspace="3" /></a> <a name="Q3" id="Q3"><strong>About how much (in dollars) would you estimate it will cost to put out all the fires?</strong></a><br />
    </p>
    <p align="justify">This is difficult to answer. The direct economic loss due to the burning  coal resources in China is estimated to be about 125 to 250 million US  dollars. The economic loss due to trapped/ unreachable coal is much higher  and is reported to be approximately 1.25 billion US dollars (Zhang Xiangmin,  1998).<br />
    </p>
    <p align="justify">The fire fighting costs vary a lot depending on the nature of the fire and  the method proposed to fight it. One needs to make a thorough investigation  on all the properties associated with that fire, then propose the most  suitable method. The costs vary from site to site. We still have not made a  complete cost-benefit study in this regard for the whole of China.</p>
    <p> <a href="#TOP"><img src="images/arrow_orange_top.gif" alt="Back to the top" border="0" hspace="3" /></a> <a name="Q4" id="Q4"><strong>Can all these fires be put out in one go? Is this even a goal?</strong></a><br />
    </p>
    <p align="justify">It is possible to put out a majority of the fires and to keep the other  fires in control so that they do not spread and cause more damage. It is  simpler to put out the more recent fires affecting near surface coal seams.  The financial involvement is also a point of concern. Putting out all the  fires in one go is not practically possible and not the intention. Sometimes  it is more feasible to isolate the fire and let it burn away the affected  coal seam, than to try to put it out. As far as this fire does not spread to  neighbouring seams and due preventive measures are taken so that no new  fires occur, I would consider our research efforts well rewarded.</p>
    <p> <a href="#TOP"><img src="images/arrow_orange_top.gif" alt="Back to the top" border="0" hspace="3" /></a> <a name="Q5" id="Q5"><strong>How much progress has been made in coal fire projects in China?</strong></a><br />
    </p>
    <p align="justify">In the projects related to the two test areas mentioned above several tasks  have been completed. First of all the areas affected by fires (surface fires  as well as underground fires) were detected and mapped. Mapping was carried  out using remote sensing data from different platforms. For regional mapping  coarse resolution thermal data from the AVHRR (spatial resolution 1.1 km -  not very useful) and night time Thematic Mapper thermal band from Landsat  satellite (spatial resolution 120 metres - quite effective) were used. Once  the areas affected by fire were broadly identified, detail surveys were  carried out using airborne data. Special aircrafts with optical and thermal  sensors were flown synchronous with the satellite overpass and ground  campaigns. These gave very good results for mapping the fire areas,  estimating depths of fires and quantifying the amount of coal lost. Such  campaigns carried out at different times (multitemporal surveys) helped to  monitor the progress/changes in the fires. As a result of these activities  the techniques to identify, map and monitor the coal fires are now well  established.<br />
    </p>
    <p align="justify">On the basis of these results and other information on the geology and  topography of the area, distance to the water bodies, concentration of  settlements and infrastructure etc., fire risk maps and fire fighting  priority maps have been generated. All this information is generated and  stored in a geographical information system (GIS), specifically designed for  coal fire areas. For the project in the Ningxia region the GIS, called  COALMAN was designed and implemented under the supervision of  Dr. Zoltan  Vekerdy. For more information on COALMAN visit the <a href="http://www.itc.nl/personal/vekerdy/EnvirGIS.htm#coa">homepage&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr.&nbsp;Zoltan&nbsp;Vekerdy</a>.</p>
    <p> <a href="#TOP"><img src="images/arrow_orange_top.gif" alt="Back to the top" border="0" hspace="3" /></a> <a name="Q6" id="Q6"><strong>Are you developing new techniques for fighting the  fires appropriate to the local environment and limited money available  in China?</strong></a><br />
    </p>
    <p align="justify">The GIS mentioned above has been developed with constant involvement of the  local fire fighting authorities and mining engineers in China. All the fire  prevention plans and fire fighting techniques proposed by the system are  made keeping in mind the local conditions. For example, liquid nitrogen  fluxion is a very effective way to cool the temperature of the hot coal  strata, but this is not proposed as it would not be economically feasable in  this study area. The GIS system only proposes solutions but interaction of  the local expertise is a very important step in the final decision making.</p>
    <p> <a href="#TOP"><img src="images/arrow_orange_top.gif" alt="Back to the top" border="0" hspace="3" /></a> <a name="Q7" id="Q7"><strong>What next steps need to be taken to deal with the problem?</strong></a><br />
      Some recommendations I would put forward are: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Try to extinguish the existing relatively new fires </li>
      <li>Try to isolate the existing old fires </li>
      <li>Try to take a scientific approach to mining practises and give due  consideration to proposed fire prevention plans </li>
      <li>Try to bring about awareness of the hazards and risks of coal fires </li>
      <li>Carry our routine monitoring of the coal mining areas using new  scientific techniques </li>
      <li>Disseminate the acquired knowledge to help other countries where  this problem exists </li>
      <li>Most important: Find funding to invest in further research in coal  fire studies </li>
    </ol>
    <p> <a href="#TOP"><img src="images/arrow_orange_top.gif" alt="Back to the top" border="0" hspace="3" /></a> <a name="Q8" id="Q8"><strong>Why is it that in the past the problem of coal  fires in China received such little attention compared to other  environmental problems?</strong></a><br />
    </p>
    <p align="justify">Most of the coal mining areas in China are located in remote and rather  sparsely populated areas. The terrain is also quite tough with a very poor  transport and communication infrastructure. Also, there is a wealth of coal  present. It is for these reasons that the coal fires which cause so much  pollution and harm were not given due attention in the past. The Chinese  Government as well as other organisations round the world are now more aware  of the problem and are considering it more seriously.</p>
