<H3>Abstract</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">China has the largest coal resources in the world but these are seriously 
endangered by coal fires. Though the problem of coal fires is long standing and 
not only limited to China, little has been done for regular monitoring of these 
fires. This Letter proposes the use of multi-temporal night-time thermal images 
acquired from Landsat Thematic Mapper band 6 for establishing a coal fire 
monitoring system for a coalfield in North-west China. Other images and map data 
are fused with the thermal images to provide a comprehensive picture of the 
fires through the years. Finally the fires are classified into different 
categories based on multi-temporal changes.<P>
