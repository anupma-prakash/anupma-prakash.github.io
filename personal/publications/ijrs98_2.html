<H3>Abstract</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This cover picture is a field photograph of a typical subsurface fire-area in the Jharia Coalfield. The area is barren of vegetation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is interpreted that heating due to subsurface fires has caused drying of the soil. This has increased its reflectance and also rendered the soil locally unfit to support vegetation over the subsurface fire areas. Thus the thermally anomalous regions are barren, as has been invariably shown by ground checks in the Jharia coalfield. Dry and barren higher temperature areas can be easily identified on satellite sensor images and these may serve as indicators of the presence of subsurface fires.<P>
