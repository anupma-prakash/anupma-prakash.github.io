<H3>Abstract</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Coal mining areas all over the world are often threatened by serious environmental hazards such as the occurrence of coalfires, land subsidence etc. Coalfires burn away the natural non-renewable coal resources, locally raise the temperature of the area, emit polluting gases  such as oxides of carbon, sulphur and nitrogen, and when present underground are even the cause of land subsidence. Mining induced subsidences, on the other hand, cause horizontal and vertical movements in the land surface, and open cracks and fissures which serve as inlets for oxygen which in turn aggravate the problem of coalfires. These inter-related phenomenon often render the mining areas unfit for human inhabitation and the commercial exploitation of coal nearly impossible in some parts. In this study, satellite data acquired in three regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, viz. optical, thermal and microwave, along with field data, are used to identify the areas affected by coalfires and land subsidence in a coalfield in Northwest China. Data fusion techniques are used for an integrated analysis of this complex problem. <P>
