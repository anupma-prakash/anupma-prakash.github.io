<center><h2>Chapter 3. Ring of Fire</h2></center>
(The narrator of this story is a Canada Goose named Tutangiaq, unless specified 
otherwise)<br><br>
<p>My relatives who nest along the Aleutian Islands tell me that they live on the 
&quot;ring of fire,&quot; an area surrounding the Pacific Ocean that is home to 
75 percent of the world's volcanoes.</p>
<p>Alaska alone is home to 8 percent of the world's active volcanoes, and about 
  80 percent of all active volcanoes within the United States. More than 100 volcanoes 
  and volcano fields have been active here within the past 1.5 million years, 
  although only 40 have been active during recorded time. With so many volcanoes, 
  you must be wondering how scientists keep track of them without visiting every 
  single one.</p>
<p>You humans have sent up satellites into orbit that look back at Earth from 
  much higher up than I could ever fly! From my perspective, I can usually see 
  only one volcano at a time. The new Landsat satellites orbit the Earth at 705 
  kilometers (interactivity 3.1) and can look at a 183 kilometers wide area in 
  one pass.</p>
<p>Objects that are hot emit a lot of energy, which a satellite's infrared sensors 
  can detect and record. The hotter the object the brighter it appears on the 
  image. Before a volcano erupts it usually has increased thermal activity which 
  appears as elevated surface temperatures (hot spots) around the volcano's crater. 
  Early detection of a hot spot and monitoring is a key factor in 
  predicting possible volcanic eruptions. Take a look at this infrared satellite 
  image. Can you find and click on the hottest spot? (interactivity 3.2)</p>
<p>A dormant volcano may look like a beautiful mountain. Do you want to see what 
  it looks like when it erupts? (interactivity 3.3)</p>
<p>This is a 2001 satellite image of Mt. Cleveland erupting out in the Aleutian 
  Islands. Look at all that ash! Did you know that ash is a serious hazard for 
  the aviation industry? (more information 3.1). It can seriously damage planes 
  and cause engines to temporarily fail, possibly leading to a disastrous crash.</p>
<p>Scientists carry out numerical modeling to predict the movement and spread 
  of ash plumes. To see a sample animation for a plume from Mt. Cleveland, Click 
  here (interactivity 3.4). This analysis was made using a program named &quot;PUFF.&quot; 
  The yellow stars represent airplanes. Once they have observed or been affected 
  by the ash plume, they turn red. Based on predictions from models such as PUFF, 
  scientists can warn the aviation industry. That's a good thing to do!</p>
<p>Oh it's hot! Let's move on to a cooler place!</p><br>

<p><u>More information 3.1:</u><br>
  Aviation safety.</p>
<p>(Picture showing the air traffic routes above the Aleutian islands, location 
  of volcanoes and historic eruptions). The airspace above the Aleutian Islands 
  is one of the heaviest traveled in the world, with more than 50,000 large aircraft 
  per year and 10,000 passengers per day traveling between Asia and North America 
  and Europe. (Source: Alaska Volcano Observatory)</p>
<p>On December 15, 1989, KLM Flight 867 from Amsterdam was descending into Anchorage 
  International Airport when it flew though a thick cloud of ash from Mt. Redoubt. 
  All four engines stalled and the standby electrical system failed. After descending 
  more than 14,000 feet, the crew was finally able to restart the engines and 
  safely land the plane. In this case the ash caused more than $80 million in 
  damage to the plane, but fortunately no lives were lost. (Source: US Geological Survey)</p>
<p><u>Interactivity 3.1</u><br>
  Conversion calculator - kilometers to miles and reverse. One can enter 
  any numeric digit and the calculator converts on the click of a button.</p>
<p><u>Interactivity 3.2</u><br>
  Hot spot detection. A gray scale AVHRR image of Mt. Cleveland and surrounding 
  area is presented. The brightest (white) region on this image is the hot spot 
  due to eruption of Cleveland Volcano. Clicking on the white hot spot, the Canada 
  goose standing close by animates &quot;Awesome&quot;. Clicking on any other 
  part of the image the same bird shakes head in an animation with the message 
  &quot;Try again&quot;.</p>
<p><u>Interactivity 3.3</u><br>
  Volcanic Eruption: On clicking the 'click here' tab, the whole screen shakes, 
  the picture on the left showing a peaceful volcano changes to a picture of an 
  erupting volcano, and Tutangiaq, the Canada goose that was earlier looking at 
  the volcano runs to the right away from the volcano.</p>
<p><u>Interactivity 3.4</u><br>
  Puff modeling results: Clicking on the &quot;Click here&quot; tab displays the 
  results of a &quot;PUFF&quot; model simulation of the eruption of the Cleveland 
  volcano. The plume from the volcano is shown to be splitting up and traveling 
  a long distance reaching unto the western US states.<br>
