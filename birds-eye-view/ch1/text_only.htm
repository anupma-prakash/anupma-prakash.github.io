<center><h1>Alaska: A Bird's Eye View</h1>
(The narrator of this story is a Canada Goose named Tutangiaq, unless specified 
otherwise)<br><br>
<h2>Chapter 1. Introduction</h2></center>
<p>Hi! My name is Tutangiaq (Too-tang-geye-ack), but math lovers can call me 2T. 
  I am a Canada Goose, or Branta canadensis for the scientists out there.</p>
<p>Each summer I travel across Alaska. Some people think that Alaska is part of 
  Canada but that's not true (more information 1.1). I love Alaska and the people 
  that live there. In fact, they gave me my name!</p>
<p>I hatched on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta in southwestern Alaska, and was given 
  the name &quot;Tutangiaq.&quot; It means &quot;Cackling&quot; in Central Yupiq 
  (more information 1.2). I have no idea why they gave me this name.</p>
<p>I have flown across Alaska so many times, and, being high up in the sky, I 
  have gotten a unique perspective. Come join me to explore this remote state!

<p><u>More information 1.1:</u><br>
  The truth about Alaska is out there ...<br>
  Alaskans do not live in igloos.<br>
  Dog mushing is primarily a sport now and not a method of transportation.<br>
  In central and northern Alaska, the winter days are dark, while summer 
  days can be continually light.<br>
  Alaska is by far the largest state in the Union. It is more than twice 
  the size of Texas.<br>
  Alaska is the northernmost, the westernmost, and the easternmost state 
  (the Aleutian Islands stretch across the International Date Line).<br>
  The record low temperature in Alaska is -80 degrees F (-62 degrees C), and the record 
  high temperature is 100 degrees F (38 degrees C).</p>
<p><u>More information 1.2:</u><br>
  (Map of Alaska showing the spatial distribution of native 
  Alaskan languages) Native Alaskan languages vary all over the state from Inupiaq 
  on the North Slope and Seward Peninsula to Tlingit along the southeastern panhandle.</p>

  Satellite image mosaic of Alaska. This picture of Alaska 
  is not just one snap shot taken from space. It is in fact a mosaic of hundreds 
  of smaller scenes. Each individual scene is about 183 km by 170 km. The scene 
  is acquired by the 'Enhanced Thematic Mapper' (ETM) sensors. These sensors are 
  onboard a NASA Earth Observation satellite called Landsat. (Check out the Landsat 
  website for more information.)<br>
  The ETM has sensors that operate in different wavelength bands. These sensors 
  record energy that is reflected from the Earth's surface. Different objects 
  on the Earth's surface reflect different amounts of energy. Consequently, the 
  information recorded by the sensors reveals the type of materials on the Earth's 
  surface. This image mosaic was generated by the Earthsat Company. The image 
  uses a combination of the six reflective bands. This provides a pleasing natural 
  color for the surface.<br>
