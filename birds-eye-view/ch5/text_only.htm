<center><h2>Chapter 5. The Golden Heart City</h2></center>
(The narrator of this story is a Canada Goose named Tutangiaq, unless specified 
otherwise)<br><br>
<p>Located in interior Alaska, the city of Fairbanks was founded in 1903 as a 
  trading post after gold was found in the area. Today, nicknamed the Golden Heart 
  of Alaska, Fairbanks and the surrounding area are home to more than 80,000 people 
  with numerous species of migratory birds passing through or stopping every year.</p>
<p>Fairbanks sits along the winding Chena River just north of the much larger 
  Tanana River. Whenever my family is passing through town, we always stop at 
  the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Do you think they might be there now?</p>
<p>The UAF campus is located West of Downtown Fairbanks and North of the Fairbanks 
  International Airport, just across the Chena River. The Airport can be identified 
  by its long straight runway and adjacent float pond. Can you help me by clicking 
  on the campus? Use this city map for more clues. (interactivity and more information 
  5.1)</p>
<p>The University of Alaska Fairbanks is Alaska's premier research and educational 
  institution. At the Geophysical Institute in particular, studies are conducted 
  related to natural processes that control the planet, especially those both 
  occurring in and affecting Alaska. (interactivity 5.2)</p>
<p>I don't see my family here. Let's look elsewhere.</p>
<p>Perhaps they are in Creamer's Field, an old dairy that has been turned into 
  a refuge for migratory birds. Can you click on it and help me find my family?</p>
<p>The refuge is North of the Chena River and Downtown Fairbanks, and off of College 
  Road. (interactivity 5.3)</p>
<p>Oh! Oh! There is my family! You found them! They are about to head north though, 
  so I'll see you later. Thank you for all your help. I hope you love Alaska now 
  as much as I do! Goodbye and maybe I'll see you around here again!</p>

<h3>Interactivity and more information in Chapter 5.</h3>
