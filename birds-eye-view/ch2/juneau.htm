                      this satellite image of Juneau and its surroundings, the 
                      city's historical center appears in the bottom right corner 
                      of the image. More buildings and developed areas appear 
                      around the center of the image. Bodies of water appear as 
                      dark blue or black, while the mountains are colored purple. 
                      The fluffy patches of white/cream are clouds that were present 
                      when the image was taken. The dark spots next to them are 
                      their shadows. Clouds, such as the ones in this image, hide 
                      parts of the surface, which can be a challenge for scientists.</font></p> </td>
