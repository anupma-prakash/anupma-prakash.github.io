<center><h2>Chapter 2. The Last Frontier</h2></center>
(The narrator of this story is a Canada Goose named Tutangiaq, unless specified 
otherwise)<br><br>
<p>First owned by Russia, Alaska was purchased by the United States of America in 
1867 for $7.2 million. This equates to, roughly, two cents an acre, where an acre 
is about half the size of a football field. Originally, many considered the purchase 
to be a &quot;folly&quot; (a reckless act), but it has proved to be a wise investment 
because of the state's rich resources. Alaska became the 49th state in 1959, and 
it adopted the nickname &quot;The Last Frontier&quot; for its rugged environment 
and its isolation from the &quot;Lower 48&quot; states. (Graphic showing Russia, 
Alaska, Canada Goose, hand shake and the original purchase check - more 
information 2.1).</p>
<p>Alaska has a population of fewer than 650,000 people. The state has a population 
  density of just over one person per square mile.</p>

<p>Alaska is such a huge state! If you were to imagine it positioned over the 
  Lower 48, Alaska would stretch from the Atlantic Ocean across the continent 
  to the Pacific Ocean. Try comparing Alaska to individual states! (Interactivity 
  2.1)</p>
<p>Normally my family and distant relatives fly from several parts of the lower 
  48 states and nest in various parts of Canada and Alaska. I will take a scenic 
  route to show you my favorite state!</p><br>

  On August 1, 1868 this check was issued to Edouard de 
  Stoeckl, Russian Minister to the United States. For $7.2 million the United 
  States acquired the Alaska territory.(Source: U.S. National Archives and Records 
  Administration)</p>

  Remote sensing color composite images. <br>
  Remote sensing images can be very colorful. Some color images look natural and 
  are called natural color composites. On such images, trees look green, clouds 
  look white and shadows look black. </p>
<p>On other images, the colors of objects can be made to look completely different 
  from what they are in real life. Such images are called false color composites. 
  In remote sensing, a very commonly used false color composite is one in which 
  healthy green trees look red. This is called a standard false color composite. 
</p>
<p>False color composites are used to highlight different Earth materials and 
  are therefore very useful for remote sensing studies. </p>
<p><u>Red dot 1: Barrow</u><br>
  Barrow is located on the northernmost point in the United States. This city 
  is 340 miles north of the Arctic Circle. In Barrow, the sun doesn't set for 
  84 days in the summer. The sun doesn't rise for 64 days in the winter!</p>
<p>(Satellite image of Barrow). Barrow is surrounded by the Arctic Ocean and many 
  lakes. This makes the North Slope (the northern part of Alaska) look like Swiss 
  cheese. Some of the lakes and the Arctic Ocean are partially frozen appearing 
  as bright whitish blue colors. Point Barrow, the northernmost point in Alaska, 
  can be clearly seen where the spit juts out into the ocean.</p>
<p><u>Red dot 2: Prudhoe Bay</u><br>
  Prudhoe Bay (Proo-dough Bay) is located on the North Slope of Alaska. This city 
  is primarily an industrial town. Prudhoe Bay marks the end of the Dalton Highway 
  and the beginning of the 800-mile Trans-Alaska Pipeline.</p>
<p>(Satellite image of Prudhoe Bay). This is a satellite image of Prudhoe Bay 
  and the surrounding area. On the image you can see small scattered rectangular 
  structures in bright cream and black colors. These are oil pumping stations 
  with gravel pads and drilling platforms. The bright lines with angular bends 
  are roads connecting the stations. Around the Prudhoe Bay area are many black 
  patches, which are lakes. Some of the lakes are partially frozen appearing as 
  blue spots. It is interesting to note that these lakes change their boundary 
  and shape with time. Two neighboring lakes may grow and merge. Lakes close to 
  the ocean may also have their sea edge eroded away forming a new bay.</p>
<p><u>Red dot 3: Fairbanks</u><br>
  The state's second largest city, Fairbanks is located 150 miles below the Arctic 
  Circle and was founded during the gold rush days in interior Alaska.</p>
<p>(Satellite image of Fairbanks). This image is of the Fairbanks city and its 
  surroundings. Buildings and other structures show up in shades of mauve (pinkish-purple), 
  while vegetation is green. The large river at the bottom of the image is the 
  famous Tanana river. The smaller winding river passing through the city is the 
  Chena River.</p>
<p><u>Red dot 4: Denali National Park and Preserve</u><br>
  Originally established in 1917 as a wildlife refuge, Denali is the fourth largest 
  national park in the nation and home to North America's tallest mountain, Mt. 
  McKinley. </p>
<p>(Satellite image of Denali National Park and Preserve). This satellite image 
  of the Denali National Park area was taken in August 2000. Glaciers appear in 
  shades of blue. Mt. McKinley is in the upper middle part of this image. North 
  America's tallest peak, Mt. McKinley measures 20,320 feet. Of America's 20 tallest 
  mountains, 17 are in Alaska, and of America's 10 largest parks, 9 are in Alaska. 
  (a photograph of Mt. McKinley is included).</p>
<p><u>Red dot 5: Anchorage</u><br>
  Anchorage is, by far, the largest city in Alaska. It has 41.5% of the state's 
  total population, or slightly more than 260,000 people.</p>
<p>(Satellite image of Anchorage). This is a 'false color' image of Anchorage. 
  The colors are called &quot;false&quot; because surface features appear very 
  different than we usually observe in reality. On the image, vegetation (trees, 
  grass, shrubs, etc.) appears in different shades of red. Man-made objects (buildings 
  and roads) appear in cyan-blue shades. The rectangular buildings arranged in 
  systematic rows along roads give a typical checkered pattern to the image, which 
  is characteristic of any big city.</p>
<p><u>Red dot 6: Juneau</u><br>
  The state capital, Juneau (Joo-no) is situated on Alaska's pan-handle. Although 
  it is Alaska's third largest city, Juneau lacks road access like many other 
  remote areas in the state.</p>
<p>(Satellite image of Juneau). On this satellite image of Juneau and its surroundings, 
  the city's historical center appears in the bottom right corner of the image. 
  More buildings and developed areas appear around the center of the image. Bodies 
  of water appear as dark blue or black, while the mountains are colored purple. 
  The fluffy patches of white/cream are clouds that were present when the image 
  was taken. The dark spots next to them are their shadows. Clouds, such as the 
  ones in this image, hide parts of the surface, which can be a challenge for 
  scientists.</p>
<p><u>Interactivity 2.1</u><br>
  Comparison of the size of Alaska with contiguous US states and each individual 
  state (comparison based on total state area, land and water). </p>
<p>A drop down menu lets the user select a state of their choice. A graphics showing 
  that particular state overlaid on the State of Alaska appears, which shows the 
  relative sizes of the two states. A numeric comparative relation also appears. 
  This comparison is based on total state area (including land and water). This 
  relationship for Alaska and the various US states is as follows:</p>
