                      is a satellite image of Prudhoe Bay and the surrounding 
                      area. On the image you can see small scattered rectangular 
                      structures in bright cream and black colors. These are oil 
                      pumping stations with gravel pads and drilling platforms. 
                      The bright lines with angular bends are roads connecting 
                      the stations. Around the Prudhoe Bay area are many black 
                      patches, which are lakes. Some of the lakes are partially 
                      frozen appearing as blue spots.<br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to note that these lakes change their 
                      boundry and shape with time. Two neighboring lakes may grow 
                      and merge. Lakes close to the ocean may also have their 
                      sea edge eroded away forming a new bay.</font></p> </td>
