<center><h2>Chapter 4. Moving Ice Edge</h2></center>
(The narrator of this story is a Canada Goose named Tutangiaq, unless specified 
otherwise)<br><br>
<p>When I fly far enough north I often encounter vast stretches of Arctic sea 
  ice, where the water has literally frozen from the extended cold weather. </p>
<p>During the summer months, the sea ice covers an average of 7,000,000 sq km, 
  but grows to around 14,000,000 sq km during the winter. By comparison, the entire 
  United States is just over 9,000,000 square km. (interactivity 4.1)</p>
<p>Over the years the thickness and extent of seasonal ice cover has decreased. 
  Scientists predict that increased melting of ice will result in a rapid warm-up 
  of the polar regions. I wonder how this Arctic warming is affecting my pinniped 
  friends, especially walruses.</p>
<p>(Walrus narrates). You're right Tutangiaq. We walruses use sea ice as an important 
  place to rest, breed, and molt. The ice breakup has been occurring earlier in 
  the year and its edge receding further now than even a decade ago. Look at these 
  satellite images which preserve a record of how the sea ice edge has changed 
  over the years. Of course, we need data for many more years to establish a reliable 
  trend. (interactivity 4.2)</p>
<p>(Walrus narrates). Did you ever wonder how these satellite images reveal changes in sea ice? Even 
  though water and ice have the same chemical formula (H2O) they have a different 
  chemical structure and physical properties. Ice has a crystalline structure 
  that reflects most of the visible energy that falls on it, making ice appear 
  bright in satellite images from the visible spectrum. Clear water on the other 
  hand tends to absorb most of the visible energy that strikes it, making water 
  appear relatively darker than ice on the same image. This contrast in the behavior 
  of water and ice can be seen as variations in tone (gray shades) on a satellite 
  image.</p>
<p>(Walrus narrates). As you may know, we pinnipeds are adapted for an aquatic environment and are 
  most vulnerable to predators out of the water. For us, sea ice is the safest 
  ground with minimum risks. From there we like to dive down to the continental 
  shelf where we feed. (more information 4.1). The farther the ice edge recedes 
  from the continental shelf in the summer and the longer that lasts, the farther 
  we have to travel to eat. Some scientists believe that the sea ice edge could 
  be receding because of gradual global warming.</p>
<p>That's terrible to hear! I know that scientists are working hard to study the 
  global environment. Some believe that we are seeing global warming. Hopefully, 
  we can all together to preserve our environment and ensure that we do not contribute 
  to global warming.</p>
<p>Oh now I am too cold! Maybe it's time for me to rejoin my migrating family.</p><br>

<h3>More information and interactivity in Chapter 4</h3>
<p><u>More information 4.1:</u><br>
  Regions of the Ocean: The ocean can be divided into several regions. (Figure 
  showing the sea with sea ice. Also shown are the coast, which extends to the 
  continental shelf, continental slope, continental rise and the deep sea bed).</p>
<p><u>Interactivity 4.1:</u><br>
  Seasonal variation in the extent of Arctic Sea Ice: Graphics showing Arctic 
  Sea Ice. The graphic has 4 tabs on top. Clicking on these tabs, the main graphic 
  changes to show the Arctic sea ice extent in March 1985, June 1985, September 
  1985, and December 1985.</p>
<p><u>Interactivity 4.2:</u><br>
  Variation in the extent of Arctic Sea Ice from 1972 through 1993: Graphics showing 
  Arctic Sea Ice. The graphic has 8 tabs on the left. Clicking on these tabs, 
  the main graphic changes to show the Arctic sea ice extent in the third week 
  of September for the years 1972, 1975, 1978, 1981, 1984, 1987, 1990 and 1993.
