<ul>
<li><strong>Mapping changes in surface hydrology in one of the test-case sites of the EPSCoR ACE project:</strong> 
<a href="https://www.alaska.edu/epscor/program%20structure/">Alaska Adapting to Changing Environments</a> (ACE) is a project that focuses on environmental and sociological changes occurring in three regions in Alaska. Read the <a href="https://www.alaska.edu/files/epscor/pdfs/2015_Midcourse_Report_EPSCoR_FINAL.pdf">mid course report</a> for background information about this project. High spatial resolution remote sensing images from the 1950s, 1980s, and 2010s are available for each of the three test-case sites of this project. One important element of the study is to map how surface hydrology has changed over time in these areas. Changes in surface hydrology impacts availability of potable water, wildlife habitat, and even transportation corridors, thereby influencing the way of life of local residents. The aim of the GEOS422 class project would be to use digital image processing to quantify changes in surface hydrology, and potentially changes in associated factors, in one of the selected study sites.</li>

  <li><strong>Re-Mapping surface temperature anomalies in the Eagle / Windfall Mountain oil-shale fire area:</strong> 
In late September of 2012, an active oil-shale fire occurred within Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve (Stromquist, 2014). A previous work analyzing the thermal anomalies from 2008 to 2013 over the Windfall Mountain site using Landsat thermal imagery concluded that this specific site was always significantly warmer than the background (even before the actual fire). The high temperature area coincided with known carbon-rich areas, and was in close proximity to visible carbonaceous material exposed on the surface. As the fire did not coincide with known lightning events, they concluded that it was likely caused due to oil shale found in that region. This study also established that thermal infrared from Landsat can detect active oil-shale fires. A good project would be to extend this research from 2014 to present using new data from Landsat-7, Landsat-8 and Terra-ASTER to determine the current state and risk potential of the Eagle / Windfall Mountain oil-shale fire area.</li>

<li><strong>Mapping wetlands through airborne hyperspectral imagery at Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge:</strong>
The Yukon Flats Basin, bisected by the Yukon River, includes over 7,100 miles of rivers and up to 40,000 lakes. The basin drains relatively undisturbed terrain and includes a high diversity of wetlands that provide critical habitat for avian and aquatic resources. Efforts to assess hydrology and classify wetlands in the Yukon Flats Basin have been ongoing since 1984 and have included ongoing development of a wetland classification system (1984-1989, 2006-present), a water resources inventory and assessment with emphasis on stream discharge (1993-1998), permafrost mapping and distribution (2010), site specific studies on water quality (2006 to present) and development of a hydrology model (2012). Many of these efforts are reliant on remote sensing methods to extrapolate information across the broader landscape to provide management relevant data to land managers. On September 2015, hyperspectral imagery from the <a href="http://www.hyperspectral.alaska.edu/hylab_airborne.html">airborne Hyspex system</a> was acquired in five areas of the Yukon Flats Basin to classify wetlands and assess water chemistry across Alaska. A good project would be to map wetlands using existing wetland categories and hyperspectral imagery.</li>

Development of ice classification methods applied to very high resolution airborne optical imagery in support of mapping Harbor seal habitats in Glacier Bay National Park</strong>: For the past six years the National Park Service Glacier Bay Field Station in Juneau has invested significant resources in acquiring high resolution airborne digital photographs over the Johns Hopkins Inlet (JHI) in the Glacial Bay National Park and Preserve. The purpose of these images is to serve as an unbiased source of information to assess: 1) the abundance and distribution of harbor seals at a selected time; 2) the availability of glacial ice habitat for the seals. The aim of this work is to identify the relationship between glacial ice availability and Harbor seal spatial distribution in JHI using the 7-year time series of digital imagery. There is potential for a student project to investigate automated methods of ice classification from the very high spatial resolution optical imagery that could include pixel-based or object-based approaches.</li></br>
  
  <li><strong>Re-investigating the Rex Creek Fire</strong>: Most forest fires in interior Alaska are caused by lighting strikes and sometimes due to human negligence. We looked at the recent Rex Creek Fire extent and lighting strike data and found that there were no known strikes in and around the fire area. Investigating a time series of Landsat and Aster thermal infrared data we found that the area where the fire started always had slightly elevated surface temperature. This area of elevated temperature corresponded with the location of carbonaceous material visible on optical images. We inferred and later confirmed from field reports that the cause of the Rex Creek Fire was a coal fire (the area is in the Nenana coal basin). A good project would be to extend this research using new data to determine the current state and risk potential of the Rex Creek area.</li>
  
 
  <li><strong>Lithological and mineral mapping on the Antarctic Peninsula using ASTER data (<em>Christian Haselwimmer)</em></strong>: there are significant gaps in the geological mapping coverage on the Antarctic Peninsula owing to difficulties in access and undertaking fieldwork in this harsh polar environment. Multispectral data acquired by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) offers potential for filling gaps in geological mapping coverage. There are a number of study areas in Palmer Land and Graham Land that could form the basis for a student project.</li>
  <li><strong>Mineral and host rock mapping in the Goodnews Bay Quadrangle, SW Alaska using ASTER data in support of mineral resource exploration and assessment (<em>Christian Haselwimmer)</em></strong>: a range of mineralization types are associated with the varied lithologies and terranes exposed in the Goodnews Bay Quadrangle of SW Alaska. The project will assess the potential of using ASTER data for host rock and mineral mapping in this area. The results will be compared against existing geological and mineral resource information. The project will particularly assess how varied vegetation cover affects the ability to undertake mapping using ASTER. This will be important for assessing how ASTER can be used for areas where rocks are marginally exposed.</li>
  <li><strong>Remote sensing of natural oil seeps in the northern Alaska Peninsula region <em>(Anupma Prakash</em>)</strong>: natural oil seeps are very common in certain regions of Alaska and occur when oil-bearing formation are exposed to faulting. Mapping of natural oil seeps using remote sensing provides the basis for resource exploration as well as monitoring of potential environmental impacts. This project will investigate the use of remote sensing to investigate natural oil seeps on the coast of the northern Alaska Peninsula. Various datasets and seep surface indicators could form the basis for a project: e.g. use of very high resolution satellite data to investigate natural oil seeps on land or use of SAR data to map natural marine oil slicks.</li>
  <li><strong>Mapping of legacy mining activities in Alaska using remote sensing (<em>Christian Haselwimmer)</em></strong>: there is a long history of mining in the State of Alaska that has left a large number of legacy mining sites, which have potential to be sources of environmental pollution. Remote sensing has potential to provide a means for mapping legacy mine sites in support of long-term monitoring activities. This broad research topic could form a number of interesting projects on the use of remote sensing data. For example: 1) use of very high resolution satellite data to investigate mine sites and assess impact on vegetation health; 2) use of satellite multispectral data for mapping of surface mine tailings and acid mine drainage.</li>
  <li><strong>Geothermal exploration in the Elim region using remote sensing <em>(Christian Haselwimmer)</em></strong>: numerous hot springs have been reported from the region of Elim on the Seward Peninsula, Alaska that have potential to be exploited as an energy source for this community. There is however, little information concerning these hot springs or other surface geothermal manifestations. The aim of this project is to investigate and map surface geothermal expressions in the Elim region including hot springs, heated ground, snow melt anomalies, and ice-free areas with a view to providing targets for field investigations. To achieve this a variety of remote sensing datasets could be investigated including thermal and optical data.</li>
