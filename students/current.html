<p><img class="align_left" src="img/josh_miller.jpg" width="100" height="133" alt="Joshua Miller" />
<strong>Joshua (Josh) Miller</strong>: is pursuing an MSc in Geology. He is developing a subsurface geologic model for the Pilgrim geothermal resource near Nome, Alaska. Josh is currently in his final write-up stage, plans to defend in Fall 2013 and start a job as a geologist with BP Alaska in Spring 2014. Josh loves to explore new research ideas, be out in the field, and take on leadership roles. He is also realizing that he has a talent for professional photography. He can be reached at <a href="jkmiller3@alaska.edu">jkmiller3@alaska.edu</a>.<br /><br /></p>

<p><img class="align_left" src="img/derek.jpg" width="100" height="133" alt="Derek Starkenburg" />
<strong>Derek Starkenburg</strong>: is an interdisciplinary PhD student pursuing research in the areas of micrometeorology, remote sensing and hydrology. Derek is a part of a NASA funded project for mapping and monitoring evapotranspiration in interior Alaska. His graduate advisory team also consists of Drs. Javier Fochesatto, Rudiger Gens, and Doug Kane. Derek's career has seen a large change moving from architecture, to meteorology, and now on to mapping evapo-transpiration. He can be reached at <a href="dpstarkenburg@alaska.edu">dpstarkenburg@alaska.edu</a>. <a href="www.et.alaska.edu" title="NASA ET Project" target="_blank">More info</a>.<br />

<p><img class="align_left" src="img/chris_waigl.jpg" width="100" height="133" alt="Chris Waigl" />
<strong>Chris Waigl</strong>: is pursuing a Ph.D. in Geophysics and for her research she uses remote sensing for investigating different aspects of forest fires in interior Alaska. More specifically, Chris is using, visible and infrared imagery from satellite and airborne platforms, to characterize wildfires in Alaska. Modeling fire behavior is also an integral component of her research. She is a recipient of the NASA Earth System Science Education Fellowship and her graduate advisory committee includes Martin Stuefer, Anupma Prakash, and Charles Ichoku. She can be reached at <a href="chris.waigl@gi.alaska.edu">cwaigl@alaska.edu</a> or at 907-4747809.<br />

<p><img class="align_left" src="img/matthew.jpg" width="100" height="133" alt="Matthew Balazs" />
<strong>Matthew Balazs</strong>: is an interdisciplinary Masters student who extensively uses  remote sensing data and techniques, and simple data visualization tools for studying mass movement and associated land surface elevation changes as a result of climate-driven natural processes. High resolution elevation data from LiDAR and GPS are central to his research. Matthew is a student intern with the Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys (DGGS) and is jointly supported by DGGS (mentor Dr. Gabriel Wolken) and the Geophysical Institute. Matthew can be reached at <a href="mailto:mbalazs@alaska.edu">mbalazs@alaska.edu</a> or at 907-4741164.<br /><br /></p>

<p><img class="align_left" src="img/stephanie.jpg" width="100" height="133" alt="Stephanie Meggers" />
<strong>Stephanie Meggers</strong>: is a Masters student in the School of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences.  Her interest is in using remote sensing to study adult Chinook habitat in the Togiak watershed in south-west Alaska. She is looking for correlations between any specific habitat elements and the fish abundance as measured from fisheries field data that she has been collecting. Steph has also been talking to the local community members and elders who believe that there have been large swings in the abundance and distribution of the fish population in the study area.  Steph is co-advised by Dr. Andrew Seitz and can be reached at <a href="mailto:slmeggers@alaska.edu">slmeggers@alaska.edu</a> <br /><br /></p>

<p><img class="align_left" src="img/josh_paul.png" width="100" height="133" alt="Josh Paul" />
<strong>Josh Paul</strong>: is an Interdisciplinary Masters student studying permafrost soils and remote sensing. He is using a combination of multispectral satellite imagery and terrain derivatives to perform digital soil mapping of remote landscapes in Alaska. Josh is developing digital soil mapping techniques specific to permafrost soils and applying these techniques to a pilot study in Arctic Alaska along the Dalton Highway corridor. Derived maps will be validated with field data. His advisory committee includes Dr. Anupma Prakash and Dr. Chien-Lu Ping. Josh can be reached at <a href="mailto:jdpaul3@alaska.edu">jdpaul3@alaska.edu</a>.<br />

<p><img class="align_left" src="img/jacob_rosenthal.png" width="100" height="133" alt="Jacob Rosenthal" /> <strong>Jacob Rosenthal</strong>: is pursuing a Masters degree in Geology. He is a structural geologist studying fracture intensities and the tectonic development of fractures in the middle and upper Jurassic strata of the Cook Inlet basin. The goal of his research is to outline a sequential deformation history for the region and to better understand what parameters control fracture density in sedimentary rocks. This research will help to ascertain the role that fractures play in the resource potential of the Cook Inlet forearc basin. Jacob is majorly advised by Dr. Elisabeth Nadin. He can be reached at <a href="mailto:jlrose09@yahoo.com">jlrose09@yahoo.com</a>.<br />

<p><img class="align_left" src="img/pete.jpg" width="100" height="133" alt="Pete Hickman" />
<strong>Pete Hickman</strong>: is a Masters student with a base in UAFs Department of Natural Reource Management. He is co-advised by Dr. Dave verbyla. Pete is using archived Landsat and Aster images from 1990s to early 2000s to map the landocover changes and associated urban heat island effects in and around Fairbanks, Alaska. Urban heat island effects are well studied for lage metropolitans in lower latitudes. However such studies are quite limited for higher latitudes. Pete can be reached at <a href="mailto:pete@gina.alaska.edu">pete@gina.alaska.edu</a> or at 907-4741567.<br /><br /></p>

<p><img class="align_left" src="img/erin.jpg" width="100" height="133" alt="Erin Trochim" />
<strong>Erin Trochim</strong>: is pursuing an interdisciplinary Ph.D. in remote sensing hydrology. She is a recepient of the NASA Earth System Science Student Fellowhip and is also supported by the UAF Graduate School. Co-advised by Doug Kane, Erin is characterizing water tracks in the Imnavait Basin in Arctic Alaska. Water tracks; associated vegetation; and processes controlling their development are sensitive to warming climate. Her preliminary research results presented at the Circum-Arctic remote sensing conference fetched her the best poster award. Erin can be reached at <a href="mailto:erintrochim@gmail.com">erintrochim@gmail.com</a> or at 907-4741157.<br /><br /></p>
