<p><img class="align_left" src="img/jason.jpg" width="100" height="133" alt="Jason Stolarski" />
<strong>Jason Stolarski</strong>: completed a Ph.D. in fisheries remote sensing being co-advised initially by Joe Margraph, and later by Trent Sutton. He studied the thermal habitat of Dolly Varden, a fish specie that is abundant in the coastal waters of Arctic Alaska. These fish are known to be sensitive to a very specific and small temperature range. Changing temperatures of coastal waters in response to recent climate change may therefore affect the fish health and distribution. He now works as a fish biologist III with the State of Massachusetts<br /><br /></p>

<strong>Antony (Tony) Berthelote</strong>: Tony was my first US graduate student who graduated with a Masters degree in Geophysics in 2005. He carried out scaled laboratory experiments to simulate conditions where a heat source, eg coal seam fire or lava tube, was present at depth. He then derived  an empirical function to estimate the depths of these linear hot sources using the associated surface temperatures as input. Tony completed his PhD. from University of Montana in 2013 and is now a faculty member at the Salish Kootenai College in Montana.

<strong>Kenya Nunez Cambra</strong> and <strong>Mongontsetseg Baldondarj</strong>: were my first graduate students. Their theses were about using remote sensing data and digital image processing techniques in conjunction with field information to update existing geological maps of parts of their country. Kenya's study area was the San Antonio del Sur area in southeast Cuba and Monogon's study area was near Ulambataar, Mongolia. Both Kenya and Mongon work for the national geological survey in their respective countries.<br /><br /></p>
