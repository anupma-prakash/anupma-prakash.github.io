<strong>Richard Carstensen</strong> is a naturalist at Discovery Southeast, a nonprofit science K-12 education center in Juneau, Alaska. He led EDGE teachers on a half day fieldtrip across an extensive local salt marsh. Carstensen utilized a PDA linked to a GPS using blue-tooth technology to annotate GIS maps in the field using ArcPAD software. He taught EDGE teachers how to map salt marsh vegetation and tie the plant elevations to tidal levels. You can read more about his organization at <a
