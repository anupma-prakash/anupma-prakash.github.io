<div class="heading">More about satellites</div>

<div class="paragraph">A satellite is launched (lifted) from the Earth's surface by a rocket. Once the satellite reaches its orbit, it continues to move in
  its orbit and does not require the push from the rocket any more. Satellite orbits can be at different distances from the Earth. Two important types of orbits are:</div>

<div class="paragraph"><div class="highlight">Geostationary orbits</div>&nbsp;are in the same plane as the equator and are about 35000 km away from the Earth.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><div class="highlight">Polar orbits</div>&nbsp;pass very close to the north and south poles (also known as near-polar orbits). They are about 700 to 800 km away from the Earth.</div>

<div id="imageDownCenter"><img src="images/orbits.jpg" height="294" width="597" alt="Illustration of polar and geostationary orbits" /><br /><br /></div>

<div class="paragraph">Depending on their use there are different kinds of satellites. </div>

<div class="paragraph"><div class="highlight">Communication satellites</div>&nbsp;help to provide radio, television and phone coverage. These satellites always look at the same point on the Earth as they revolve around the Earth (geostationary).</div>

<div class="paragraph">Some&nbsp;<div class="highlight">weather satellites</div>&nbsp;are geostationary. Others are in polar orbit. They all provide information that is used for weather forecast.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><div class="highlight">Navigational satellites</div>&nbsp;are special satellites that help us to find our exact location on the Earth. GPS (Global Positioning Systems) receivers that you can now buy at many stores use these satellites to show us our location.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><div class="highlight">Satellites for planetary/astronomical studies</div>
&nbsp;point away from the Earth and are used to study  outer space and other planets.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><div class="highlight">Earth observing satellites</div>&nbsp;are specially designed to study the processes on Earth. Many of these satellites occupy near-polar orbits. Some also operate in other orbit types.</div>
