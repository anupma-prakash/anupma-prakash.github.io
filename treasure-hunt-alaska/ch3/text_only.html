<div class="heading">Chapter 3: Satellites and satellite images (text only)</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Uncle Roger:</em><br />
A satellite is something that moves around something else. Satellites follow a fixed path, known as an orbit.</div>
<div class="paragraph">Scientists have sent many satellites into outer space that revolve around the Earth. These satellites continuously take pictures of the Earth. We can use these satellite images to study the Earth.</div>
<div class="paragraph">The science of acquiring and studying these images is called satellite remote sensing.</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Julie:</em><br />
The moon also moves around the Earth. Is the moon a satellite?</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Uncle Roger:</em><br />
That is a very good question. The moon is indeed a satellite. It is a natural satellite. What I was talking about are  satellites made by people.</div>
<div class="paragraph">The Earth has one moon. Some other planets in our solar system have many moons.</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Steve:</em><br />
But why do we want satellites to take pictures of the Earth? I can take pictures
of anything with my camera.</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Uncle Roger:</em><br />
This is because you are very close to the Earth's surface. Remember, when you are very close, you see a small area.
To take pictures of the whole Earth, you have to be very far away. Satellites are very far away from the Earth's surface.
They see a large part of the Earth in one satellite image.</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Steve:</em><br />
I still think my camera is better. It has a big flash  and I can take pictures in the dark. I am sure that satellites can not take pictures when it is dark.</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Uncle Roger:</em><br />
Some satellites need sunlight to take images. There are other satellites that work like your flash camera.
Instead of a bright flash they send out a wave-like signal. The signal is known as a radar signal or a microwave signal. The signal
hits the Earth's surface and goes back to the satellite. The satellite uses the radar signal to make an image. These satellites are known as
SAR satellites. SAR stands for synthetic aperture radar.</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Tim:</em><br />
Can the satellites see through  clouds?</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Steve:</em><br />
Are the microwave signals like the microwave in our kitchen?</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Uncle Roger:</em><br />
The microwave in the kitchen is used to cook food. Microwaves can pass through the surface of the food and heat it up.</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Similarly, the microwave signals sent by the SAR satellite can pass the clouds and see through them. This makes SAR satellites special. We can get SAR images of the Earth even when there are clouds in the sky. Because SAR satellites do not depend on sunlight, they can produce SAR images day and night.</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Steve:</em><br />
I think SAR satellites are cool! 
But what do SAR images look like? How can we use them to find our treasure?</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Julie:</em><br />
How large is the area I can see on a SAR image?</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Uncle Roger:</em><br />
One standard SAR image covers an area of about 100 times 100 kilometers.</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Julie:</em><br />
You said one image was approximately 10,000 square kilometers. Imagine that great-grandfather lost the treasure somewhere between Anchorage and Nome. This is about 1,800 kilometers. Let us say he could have gone about 100 kilometers away on either side of the main track. Then we will need to search an area of 360,000 square kilometers. We need to see at least 36 images.</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Tim:</em><br />
Wow! That was great. You should be a mathematician.</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Julie:</em><br />
But, I already am.</div>

<div class="subheading_extra">More information: More about satellites</div>
<div class="paragraph">A satellite is launched (lifted) from the Earth's surface by a rocket. Once the satellite reaches its orbit, it continues to move in
  its orbit and does not require the push from the rocket any more. Satellite orbits can be at different distances from the Earth. Two important types of orbits are:</div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="highlight">Geostationary orbits</div>&nbsp;are in the same plane as the equator and are about 35000 km away from the Earth.</div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="highlight">Polar orbits</div>&nbsp;pass very close to the north and south poles (also known as near-polar orbits). They are about 700 to 800 km away from the Earth.</div>
<div class="paragraph">Depending on their use there are different kinds of satellites. </div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="highlight">Communication satellites</div>&nbsp;help to provide radio, television and phone coverage. These satellites always look at the same point on the Earth as they revolve around the Earth (geostationary).</div>
<div class="paragraph">Some&nbsp;<div class="highlight">weather satellites</div>&nbsp;are geostationary. Others are in polar orbit. They all provide information that is used for weather forecast.</div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="highlight">Navigational satellites</div>&nbsp;are special satellites that help us to find our exact location on the Earth. GPS (Global Positioning Systems) receivers that you can now buy at many stores use these satellites to show us our location.</div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="highlight">Satellites for planetary/astronomical studies</div>
&nbsp;point away from the Earth and are used to study  outer space and other planets.</div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="highlight">Earth observing satellites</div>&nbsp;are specially designed to study the processes on Earth. Many of these satellites occupy near-polar orbits. Some also operate in other orbit types.</div>

<div class="subheading_extra">More information: More about moons</div>
<div class="paragraph">Natural satellites that orbit planets are often called moons.</div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="list_heading_extra">Did you know that:</div>
<ul>
<li>There are at least 140 moons within Earth's solar system.</li>
<li>Jupiter has more than 60 moons and Saturn has more than 40 moons.</li>
<li>Mercury and Venus have no moons at all.</li>
<li>Earth has one large moon ("The Moon").</li>
<li>Mars has two tiny moons.</li>
<li>Pluto has a very large moon named Charon (sometimes considered  a double planet).</li>

<div class="subheading_extra">More information: More about satellite images</div>
<div class="paragraph">Satellites carry instruments called sensors. Most satellites have multiple sensors.</div>
<div class="paragraph">One good way of categorizing satellite sensors and satellite remote sensing is by the energy required to collect data.</div>
<div class="paragraph">When an external energy source is required to carry out remote sensing it is called <div class="highlight">active remote sensing</div>. Active remote sensing can be done day and night. The SAR images shown later in the story are all from active remote sensing.</div>
<div class="paragraph">When the sensors rely on the energy coming from natural sources, it is called <div class="highlight">passive remote sensing</div>. The natural source could be the sun. In this type of passive remote sensing the sun's energy is reflected by the Earth's surface. And this kind of remote sensing can be done only during the day.</div>
<div class="paragraph">In other types of passive remote sensing the energy coming out of the Earth's surface is recorded. This type can be carried out at day and night.</div>

<div class="subheading_extra">Math activity: Follow Julie's calculations and try some for yourself</div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="highlight">Note: you can use the help of a pocket calculator, or the calculator provided here.</div></div>
<div class="paragraph">Julie believes that Samuel may have traveled from Nome to Fairbanks to Anchorage. This total route is about 1800 km long.</div>
<div class="paragraph">Julie thinks that Samuel could have gone 100 km away on either side of the main track between Nome, Fairbanks and Anchorage. 100 km on either side means a total distance of 200 km across the main track.</div>
<div class="paragraph">You can imagine this as a 200 km broad zone where the track is in the middle. Scientists refer to such zones as "buffer zones." This buffer zone is the children's search zone.</div>
<div class="paragraph">The total area of the search zone = total length of the track multiplied by the total thickness of the buffer zone.
The total search area = 1800 km * 200 km = 360,000 sq km.</div>
<div class="paragraph">Each SAR image is about 100 km long and 100 km wide. Therefore total area covered by a SAR image is 100 km * 100 km = 10,000 sq km.</div>
<div class="paragraph">The minimum number of SAR images required to cover the total search area = total search area divided by total area of a SAR image = 360000/10000 = 36 images.</div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="highlight">Note: In reality one would need  many more images because successive images overlap and it is not possible to have an image start exactly where your search area starts.</div></div> 
<div class="paragraph">Now calculate at least how many images the children would need to see if Samuel could have gone</div>
<ol>
<li>50 kilometers on either side of the main track.</li>
<li>200 kilometers on either side of the main track.</li>
</ol>
