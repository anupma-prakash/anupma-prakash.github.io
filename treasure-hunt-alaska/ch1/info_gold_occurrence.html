<div class="heading">Occurrence of gold</div>

<div class="paragraph">Gold is one of the most precious metals and is called a "noble metal" because it does not react with air under ordinary conditions. Gold is deposited from solutions containing dissolved gold.</div>

<div class="paragraph">There are two main types of gold deposits. When gold is found at the place where it was formed, the deposit is called a primary deposit, or a <div class="highlight">lode deposit</div>. When gold moves away from its primary location by wind, water, ice, or gravity, it can concentrate in another place to form a secondary deposit called a <div class="highlight">placer deposit</div>. In a placer deposit gold can be found as clumps (nuggets), as small particles, or as gold dust.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Gold is very heavy, and usually does not travel very far

  from its source. Miners often find placer gold in streams and pan their way

  up the stream until they reach the lode deposit. Much of the gold produced in

  Alaska was mined from placers.
