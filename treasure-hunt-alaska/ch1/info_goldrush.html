<div id="imageUpRight"><img src="images/usa.jpg" height="371" width="300" alt="Map showing Alaska being a part of the US" /></div>

<div class="paragraph">Alaska is the northernmost state of the United States of America (USA). It is not connected to the 48 states making up the mainland US (also known as the Lower 48 by the Alaskans). Alaska was accepted as the 49th State of the USA in 1959.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Gold has played a big role in Alaska's history. Alaska's first big discovery of gold came in Juneau in 1880. This was followed by other important gold strikes in Klondike and Nome. The discovery of gold brought thousands of men and women to Alaska. The period from 1880 to 1914 is known as the gold rush era.</div>



<div class="paragraph"><div class="list_heading">Did you know that:</div>

<ul>

<li>Alaska's capital city, Juneau, is named after Joseph Juneau, one of the miners who first found gold there in 1880.</li>

<li>Gold is Alaska's state mineral.</li>

<li>Miners have found pieces of gold (nuggets) that are the size of a large fist.</li>
