<div class="heading">Chapter 4: Understanding SAR images (text only)</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Uncle Roger:</em><br />
I have some SAR images with me. Have a look at these images.</div>
<div class="paragraph">This is a SAR image of a river.</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Steve:</em><br />
That is easy. I could have told you that. Look at all the meanders (bends). Only a river can form such a shape.</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Uncle Roger:</em><br />
Here is an image of a glacier.</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Tim:</em><br />
This is so exciting. Look at all the stripes. I can make out how the ice is flowing.</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Uncle Roger:</em><br />
I also have an image of a city. This looks very different.</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Tim:</em><br />
This is confusing. What are all those bright spots? Are they having fireworks in the city?</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Uncle Roger:</em><br />
In cities you have many roads and buildings. The buildings next to roads can act as corner reflectors. A corner reflector is an object that returns a signal to where it came from using multiple reflections.</div> 
<div class="paragraph">The signal sent from the satellite bounces off the road, hits the side of the building, and then returns straight back to the satellite.</div>
<div class="paragraph">This signal that reaches straight back to the satellite is very strong. It produces a bright spot in the image.</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Julie:</em><br />
Oh, now I see. Perhaps, the treasure box will also serve as a corner reflector. Then it will show up as a bright feature on the SAR image. We can use this clue to find it.</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Uncle Roger:</em><br />
You are right. Good luck with your mission.</div>

<div class="subheading_extra">More information: Alaskan Rivers</div>
<div class="paragraph">Alaska has thousands of rivers. More than 12,000 rivers have been counted, but this number does not include thousands of smaller tributaries (streams that flow into a larger river or lake).</div>
<div class="paragraph">The Yukon River is the longest river in Alaska and is more than 1,980 miles long (source: USGS). The river starts in the Yukon, Canada and flows through Alaska.</div>
<div class="paragraph">The other three important rivers are the Kuskokwim River, the Colville River, and the Copper River.</div>
<div class="paragraph">Rivers in Alaska serve as a source of water, food, and routes of transportation.
</div>

<div class="subheading_extra">More information: Alaskan glaciers</div>
<div class="paragraph">Glaciers are an important part of Alaska's landscape.</div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="list_heading_extra">Did you know that:</div>
<ul>
<li>While Alaska makes up approximately 17 percent of the area in the US, it accounts for one-third of the US fresh water supply.</li>
<li>Over three-quarters of Alaska's water are "locked up" in the form of glaciers.</li>
<li>Approximately 5 percent of Alaska (about 29,000 square miles) is covered by glaciers.</li> 
<li>Alaska's glaciers are located primarily in the southcentral and southeastern portions of the state.</li> 
<li>The famous Columbia Glacier has retreated (become smaller) over a mile in less than a decade.</li> 
<li>If all the glaciers in Alaska melt, the sea level will rise by nearly a foot.</li>
</ul>
