<div class="paragraph"><em>Steve:</em><br />
Our teacher told us that there are so many children in the world who are very poor. 
Instead of going to school and to play, they have to work to get food. This is so sad. 
If only we could get that gold box, we could help these children so that they could also go to school like us.</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Tim:</em><br />
Perhaps we can get a magic carpet and fly around Alaska to find the treasure.</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Steve:</em><br />
That only happens in fairy tales. Perhaps we can take our sled to Alaska to hunt for the treasure.</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Julie:</em><br />
That will not work. You already know how vast Alaska is. Have you thought about the extreme cold and rugged terrain? We will never be able to carry out our
  treasure hunt on sleds.</div>
<div class="paragraph">I think we should take advice from our scientist Uncle Roger who works in Alaska. We are so lucky that he is on vacation and will be visiting us tomorrow.</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Uncle Roger:</em><br />
So, you want to find a large metal box that is lost in Alaska somewhere between Nome, Anchorage and Fairbanks.</div>
<div class="paragraph">Hmm, I have an idea! You can use satellite images for your treasure hunt.</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<em>Tim:</em><br />
But what are satellites and what are satellite images?</div>

<div class="subheading_extra">More information: Alaska - The Last Frontier</div>
<div class="paragraph">Due to its remote location, harsh weather, and rugged terrain, Alaska is also known as the Last Frontier.</div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="list_heading_extra">Did you know that:</div>
<ul>
<li>Alaska is the largest state of the US (365 million acres of land), and yet it has the third smallest population (only 606,000 people, exceeding only Vermont and Wyoming).</li>
<li>Alaska has less than 12,000 miles of paved roads.</li>
<li>Weather in Alaska can be extreme and unpredictable.</li>
<li>The record low temperature in Alaska is -80&deg;F (-62&deg;C), and the record high temperature is 100&deg;F (38&deg;C).</li>
<li>17 out of 20 tallest mountains in the US are in Alaska, including North America's tallest mountain, Mt. McKinley, or Denali.</li>
<li>9 out of the 10 largest parks in the US are in Alaska.</li>
</ul>
