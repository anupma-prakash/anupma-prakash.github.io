<div class="heading">Chapter 5: Hard work (text only)</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Julie:</em><br />
We  worked hard for several days trying to learn more about SAR images. We talked to friends, went to the library and even searched the Internet. </div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Steve:</em><br />
We learned that the Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF) at the University of Alaska Fairbanks has the largest collection of SAR images for 
Alaska. We wrote to ASF telling them about our mission and received lots and lots of SAR images. We started looking carefully at each 
image.</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Tim:</em><br />
I found it! I found it! In fact, I have found  many treasure boxes. Look, there are so many bright points!</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Steve:</em><br /> 
Think about it. Great-grandfather only had one treasure box. Here you have many bright points and all in one line. This  looks like a long metal thing, perhaps the Pipeline that grandma told us about. Let us look somewhere else.</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Tim:</em><br />
Oh, this time I have really found it.</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Julie:</em><br />
This looks like a bright target on open water. I think this can not be our treasure box. Our treasure box is full of gold and would sink in the water. This is perhaps a ship sailing by. Look at the 'tail' it has formed by disturbing the calm water.</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Steve:</em><br />
We have spent countless number of hours looking at the SAR images. We have identified seventeen sites. 
Our treasure box may be at any one of these sites.</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Julie:</em><br />
We must go to Alaska to find if our treasure box is at one of these sites.</div>
<div class="paragraph"><em>Tim:</em><br />
Uncle Roger and his friends have promised to help us in Alaska. I am so excited. I am also very nervous. I really hope we find the treasure.</div>

<div class="subheading_extra">More information: About the UAF, GI, and ASF</div>
<div class="paragraph">The University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF)
<ul>
<li>is the nation's northernmost Land, Sea, and Space Grant university.</li>
<li>was founded in 1917 and has about 10,000 students from 50 states and 39 foreign countries.</li>
<li>has 8 campuses across the state.</li>
<li>is the home of the Nanooks (Eskimo word for polar bear), a name given to UAF sport teams.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">The Geophysical Institute (GI)
<ul>
<li>is the flagship research institute of UAF.</li>
<li>has scientific research projects which reach from the center of the Sun to the center of the Earth and beyond.</li>
<li>has about 60 faculty and 80 graduate/undergraduate students carrying out research at high latitudes relating to their location within the Arctic.</li>
<li>operates the Poker Flat Research Range, the world's only university-owned scientific rocket launching facility.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">The Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF)
<ul>
<li>is housed within the Geophysical Institute at UAF.</li>
<li>is one of the Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).</li>
<li>downlinks, processes, archives, and distributes SAR data from many SAR satellites.</li>
</ul>

<div class="subheading_extra">More information: About the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System</div>
<div class="paragraph">The Trans Alaska Pipeline System, called "The Pipeline" by Alaskans, is one of the greatest engineering projects of the world.</div>
<div class="paragraph">In 1968, oil was discovered on the North Slope of Alaska. The only way to carry this oil from the North Slope of Alaska was by a pipeline over land. In the 1970s the 800 mile-long Pipeline was constructed to move oil from Prudhoe Bay on the Arctic Ocean (start point) to the port of Valdez (end point). Valdez is the northernmost ice-free port in North America.</div>
<div class="paragraph">The Pipeline
<ul>
<li>is 800 miles long.</li>
<li>uses pipes with a 48 inch diameter.</li>
<li>construction started in 1975 and completed in 1977.</li>
<li>cost $8 billion in 1977 to build.</li>
<li>crosses three mountain ranges and over 800 rivers and streams.</li>
<li>accounts for roughly 20 percent of US oil production annually.</li>
</ul>
