<div class="subheading"><p>A1 - Science as Inquiry and Process<p/>
Standard SA1 Students develop an understanding of the processes of science used to investigate problems, design and conduct repeatable scientific investigations, and defend scientific arguments.
</div>
<ul>
  <li>[3,4,5,6] GLE SA1.1 asking questions, predicting, observing, describing, measuring, classifying, making generalizations, inferring, and communicating</li>
  <li>[3] GLE SA1.2 observing and describing the student's own world to answer simple questions</li>
  <li>[4] GLE SA1.2 observing, measuring, and collecting data from explorations and using this information to classify, predict, and communicate</li>
  <li>[5] GLE SA1.2 using quantitative and qualitative observations to create inferences and predictions</li>
</ul>

<div class="subheading">Standard SA2 Students develop an understanding that the processes of science require integrity, logical reasoning, skepticism, openness, communication, and peer review.</div>
<ul>
  <li>[3] GLE SA2.1 answering "how do you know?" questions with reasonable answers</li>
</ul>

<div class="subheading"><p>D1 Concepts of Earth Science<p/>
Standard SD2 Students develop an understanding of the origins, ongoing processes, and forces that shape the structure, composition, and physical history of the Earth.</div>
<ul>
  <li>[3] GLE SD2.1 identifying and comparing a variety of Earth's land features (i.e., rivers, deltas, lakes, glaciers, mountains, valleys, and islands)</li>
  <li>[4] GLE SD2.1 observing models of how waves, wind, water, and ice shape and reshape the Earth's surface by eroding rock and soil (L)</li>
  <li>[4] SD2.2 identifying causes identifying causes (i.e., earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, floods, landslides, and avalanches) of rapid changes on the surface</li>
  <li>[5] GLE SD4.1 recognizing that stars are like the sun but are so far away that they look like points of light</li>
  <li>[6] GLE SD4.1 contrasting characteristics of planets and stars (i.e., light reflecting, light emitting, orbiting, orbited, composition)</li>
</ul>

<div class="subheading"><p>E1 Science and Technology<p/>
Standard SE1 Students develop an understanding of how scientific knowledge and technology are used in making decisions about issues, innovations, and responses to problems and everyday events.</div>
<ul>
  <li>[3] GLE SE1.1 identifying local problems and discussing solutions (L)</li>
</ul>

<div class="subheading">Standard SE2 Students develop an understanding that solving problems involves different ways of thinking, perspectives, and curiosity that lead to the exploration of multiple paths that are analyzed using scientific, technological, and social merits</div>
<ul>
  <li>[4] GLE SE2.2 identifying multiple explanations (e.g., oral traditions, folklore, scientific theory) of everyday events (e.g., weather, seasonal changes)</li>
  <li>[5] GLE  SE2.1 investigating a problem or project over a specified period of time and identifying the tools and processes used in that project (L)</li>
  <li>[6] GLE  SE2.1 identifying, designing, testing, and revising solutions to a local problem (L)</li>
</ul>

<div class="heading">Additionally Applicable Alaska Geography, History and Math Standards</div>

<div class="subheading"><p>Geography<p/>
Content Standard C- A student should understand the dynamic and interactive natural forces that shape the Earth's environments. A student who meets the content standard should</div>
<ul>

</ul>

<div class="subheading"><p>History<p/>
Content Standard C - A student should develop the skills and processes of historical inquiry. A student who meets the content standard should</div>
<ul>
<li>C-1) use appropriate technology to access, retrieve, organize, and present historical information</li>
<li>C-3) apply thinking skills, including classifying, interpreting, analyzing, summarizing, synthesizing, and evaluating, to understand the historical record</li>
</ul>
